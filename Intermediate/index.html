	<article>The Rimac C Two, stylized as C_Two, is a semi-autonomous all-electric sports car designed and manufactured by the Croatian automotive manufacturer Rimac Automobili.[3] Unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, it is the automaker's second car after the Rimac Concept One and is described as a significant technological leap, dubbed "a car alive with technology". The exterior was designed by the Croatian-born Austrian Adriano Mudri.

	Rimac plans to produce 150 vehicles[4][5] and is currently in the process of homologation for the global market.[6] The first deliveries are expected to take place in 2020.[7] The C_Two was priced at â‚¬1,795,532. The car was sold out almost three weeks after its launch.[8]
